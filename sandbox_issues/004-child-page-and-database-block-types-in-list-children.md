# listChildren examples with child_page and child_database block types

The `GET /v1/blocks/{block_id}/children` endpoint examples only return
`paragraph` blocks. To test handling for pages that contain subpages or
inline databases, the sandbox needs examples that include `child_page` and
`child_database` block types.
